# Credit_score_prediction_project

* I will be performing Exploratory Data Analysis to extract the key insights on how different parameters are related to the different credit score brackets of the customers.
* Then on the next step, I will apply Classification models like Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost to predict the credit score classes.
* Lastly I will compare their predicition accuracy and make some inferences.
